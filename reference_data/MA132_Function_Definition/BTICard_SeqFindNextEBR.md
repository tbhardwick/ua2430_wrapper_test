### **RETURNS**

A negative value if an error occurs or zero if successful.

# **DESCRIPTION**

Finds the next EBR-1553 record in the Sequential Record buffer and updates *\*pRecord* to point to that record. This function uses and updates data in the *sfinfo* structure. Calling this function repeatedly returns the EBR records one at a time until the end of the buffer is reached (at which time it returns an error value). Thus, messages can be individually saved to disk, displayed on screen, etc. Using the predefined Sequential Record structure SEQRECORDEBR allows for easy handling of the data.

Extract the channel number from the activity word by AND-ing the activity field with MSGACTEBR\_CHMASK and right-shifting the result by MSGACTEBR\_CHSHIFT. The resulting value is the channel number associated with the EBR-1553 record.

channel = (activity & MSGACTEBR\_CHMASK) >> MSGACTEBR\_CHSHIFT;

The RT Link number that the command was sent on can be extracted from cwdinfo field through the same process.

cwdlink = (cwdinfo & CWDINFOEBR\_LINKMASK) >> CWDINFOEBR\_LINKSHIFT;

This is also done to determine the RT Link number the response was seen on using the swdinfo field.

swdlink = (swdinfo & SWDINFOEBR\_LINKMASK) >> SWDINFOEBR\_LINKSHIFT;

The configured Logical Hub mode can also be extracted from the activity word. The MODE bits must be masked and shifted by doing the following

mode = (activity & MSGACTEBR\_MODEMASK) >> MSGACTEBR\_MODESHIFT;

Then the mode can be directly compared against the following values

| LHub Mode       |                              |  |
|-----------------|------------------------------|--|
| Constant        | Description                  |  |
| LHUBMODE_SPEC   | The LHub is in "spec" mode   |  |
| LHUBMODE_SWITCH | The LHub is in "switch" mode |  |
| LHUBMODE_LINK   | The LHub is in "link" mode   |  |

#### Comparison is as follows

if (mode == LHUBMODE\_SPEC)

# **DEVICE DEPENDENCY**

When IRIG is enabled on a 4G Device, time-tags in message structures and Sequential Records will be in BCD format (see BTICard\_TimerStatus).

### **WARNINGS**

Must be preceded by a call to BTICard\_SeqFindInit.
