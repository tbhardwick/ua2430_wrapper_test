## **RETURNS**

A negative value if an error occurs, or zero if successful.

## **DESCRIPTION**

Clears any transmit Schedule for the specified channel and creates a new transmit Schedule that sequences messages at given intervals. The new Schedule will consist of *nummsgs* messages, each transmitted within an interval specified by the *min* and *max* interval arrays (in units of milliseconds). *msgs* points to an array of message addresses, each previously generated by a call to BTI429\_MsgCreate.

The nth element of the *msgs* array uses the nth element of the *min* and *max* intervals arrays to create the Schedule.

The function schedules messages and gaps to generate the specified transmit intervals. If the Schedule cannot be generated, an error is returned.

If the range of every interval is zero (the min and max value of each pair are the same), then no range checking is performed on the resulting schedule.

#### **DEVICE DEPENDENCY**

Applies to all Devices.

#### **WARNINGS**

A call to BTI429\_ChConfig must precede this function as well as a call to BTI429\_MsgCreate for each message to be Scheduled.
